\section{Conclusion}

While this paper is a deep dive into a specific issue with ERC20, it also illustrates a number of higher level lessons for blockchain developers. When ERC20 standard was first implemented, it changed how people used Ethereum, giving rise to an ICO craze with its ease of use~\cite{fenu2018ico}. This led to the deployment of thousands of early implementation of ERC20 tokens which has resulted in numerous attacks on different implementations. Now we see decentralized exchanges relying on existing ERC20 tokens and the \textit{``Multiple Withdrawal Attack''} seems too important to ignore. Fixing existing ERC20 code will help future deployments but cannot fix the already deployed tokens. In addition to deploying secure contracts, we suggest blockchain developers conduct external audits and consider security-by-design practices when dealing with other smart contract implementations.
