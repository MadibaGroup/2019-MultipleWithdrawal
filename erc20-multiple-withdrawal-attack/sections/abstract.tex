\begin{abstract}

Custom tokens are an integral component of decentralized applications (dapps) deployed on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. For Ethereum, the ERC20 standard is a widely used token interface and is interoperable with many existing dapps, user interface platforms, and popular web applications (\eg exchange services). An ERC20 security issue, known as the \textit{multiple withdrawal attack}, was raised on GitHub and has been open since October 2017. The issue concerns ERC20's defined method  \texttt{approve()} which was envisioned as a way for token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped number of tokens. The security issue arrises when a token holder wants to adjust the amount of approved tokens from amount $N$ to amount $M$. If malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for $N$ tokens can front-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw $N$ tokens, then allow the approval to be confirmed, and then withdraw an additional $M$ tokens. In this paper, we evaluate 10 proposed mitigations for this issues and find that no solution is fully satisfactory. We then propose 2 new solutions that mitigate the attack, one of which fully fulfils our evaluation criteria, and we also show a general limitation in addressing this issue from ERC20's approve method.
