\begin{abstract}
Tokens represent digital assets (\textit{e.g.,} company shares, fiat currency, non-fungible assets, \textit{etc.}) on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 is one of the major token standards that defines a group of interfaces for standardizing interoperability of tokens. Therefore, web services and other blockchain applications can use and interact with tokens. Similar to any other smart contract that is written in \textit{Solidity}, ERC20 tokens are vulnerable to security flaws. In this report, we (i) examine most significant discovered vulnerabilities on ERC20 tokens and (ii) propose a secure ERC20 code that can be further used as a reference implementation.
