We used a variety of code audit tools on \sys to validate the code and also to illuminate the completeness and error-rate of such tools on one specific use-case (similar work studies in less depth a variety of use-cases~\cite{AuditTools}). We did not adapt older tools that support lower versions of the Solidity compiler (\eg Oyente). The following seven tools are all publicly available.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item EY Review Tool \footnote{\url{https://review-tool.blockchain.ey.com}} by Ernst \& Young Global Limited.
	\item SmartCheck\footnote{\url{https://tool.smartdec.net}} by SmartDec.
	\item Securify\footnote{\url{https://securify.chainsecurity.com}} by ChainSecurity.
	\item ContractGuard\footnote{\url{https://contract.guardstrike.com}} by GuardStrike.
	\item MythX\footnote{\url{https://mythx.io}} by ConsenSys.
	\item Slither Analyzer\footnote{\url{https://github.com/crytic/slither}} by Crytic.

 A total of 89 audits have been conducted by these auditing tools. Audits include best practices and security vulnerabilities. The results are summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:result}--\ref{tab:result3} and sorted by Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC).\footnote{\url{https://swcregistry.io/}}) Knowledge-base of each tool is used to map the audits to the corresponding SWC registry \cite{SECURIFYGIT,SMARTCHECK,MythX,ContractGuard,SlitherDoc}. Since each tool employs different methodologies to analyze smart contracts (\eg comparing with violation patterns, applying a set of rules, using static analysis, \etc), there are false positives as expected. The following are some examples of ignored false positives:
 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{MythX} detects a \textit{Re-entrancy attack} in the \textit{noReentrancy} modifier. In Solidity, modifiers are used to add features or apply some restriction on function~\cite{SolidityModifer}. Using the \textit{noReentrancy} modifier is a known technique (via Mutex) to mitigate the attack~\cite{ReentrancyGuard}. This is a false positive and note that other tools have not identified it.
	\item The \textit{EY review tool} considers \texttt{decreaseAllowance} and \texttt{increaseAllowance} as standard \erc functions and if not implemented, recognizes the code as vulnerable to a \textit{front-running} attack. These two functions are not defined in the \erc standard~\cite{ERC20Std} and considered only by this tool as standard \erc functions. There are other methods to prevent the attack while adhering \erc specifications (see Rahimian \etal for a full paper on this attack and the basis of the mitigation in \sys~\cite{ERC20MWA}). The tool also falsely detects the \textit{Overflow} attack, mitigated through \texttt{SafeMath}. Another identified issue is \textit{Funds can be held only by user-controlled wallets}. The tool warns agains any token transfer to Ethereum addresses that belong to smart contracts. However, interacting with \erc token by other smart contracts was one of the main motivations of the \erc standard.
	\item \textit{SmartCheck} recommends not using \texttt{SafeMath} and instead use explicit checks where overflows might be possible. It also flags \textit{using private modifier}. They mention in the knowledge-base that ``miners have access to all contractsâ€™ data and developers must account for the lack of privacy in Ethereum," however private visibility in Solidity concerns object oriented inheritance not confidentiality. The tool also warns against \texttt{approve()} in \erc due to front-running attacks (see above). Despite EIP-1884, the tool still recommends using of \texttt{transfer()} method with stipend of 2300 gas.
	\item The proposal could not pass \textit{Re-entrancy} check of \textit{Securify} while both CEI and Mutex are implemented. It identifies \texttt{noReentrancy} modifier as unsafe due to unrestricted writes~\cite{SECURIFY}. Modifiers are not accessible by users and are the recommended approach to prevent \textit{Re-entrancy}.
	\item Using \texttt{SafeMath} is flagged as a \textit{Delegatecall to untrusted callee} vulnerability by \textit{SmartCheck}. In Solidity, embedded libraries are called by JUMP commands instead of Delegatecall. Therefore, excluding embedded libraries from this check might improve accuracy of the audit tool.
\end{itemize}


After manually overriding the false positives, the average percentage of passed checks for \sys reaches to 96\%. The remaining issues are attributed to outdated requirements in the audit tools, including the following examples.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The current version of analyzers in \textit{Slither} detect two \textit{low level call} vulnerabilities in \sys~\cite{SlitherSetup}. This is due to using of \texttt{msg.sender.call.value()} that is recommend way of transferring ETH after \textit{Istanbul} hard-fork (EIP-1884).	Therefore, adapting analyzers to new standards can improve accuracy of the security checks.
	\item \textit{EY review tool} checks for maximum 50000 gas in \texttt{approve()} and 60000 in \texttt{transfer()} method. We could not find corresponding SWC registry or standard recommendation on these limitations.
	\item Locking solidity version to 0.5.11 is detected by \textit{Odin} as an \textit{Outdated compiler version}. We have used this version due to its compatibility with all auditing tools. Furthermore, other tools have not identified such an issue.
\end{itemize}
