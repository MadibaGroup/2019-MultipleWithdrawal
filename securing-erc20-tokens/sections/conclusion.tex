\section{Conclusion}

The development of smart contracts has proven to be error-prone in practice, and as a result, contracts deployed on public platforms are often riddled with security vulnerabilities. Exploited by the attackers, these vulnerabilities can often lead to major security incidents which introduce great cost due to the immutability characteristics of the blockchain technology. In this paper, we examine ERC20 security vulnerabilities and thoroughly discuss the technical details, the circumstances of the incidents together with their impacts and mitigations. We also integrate best practices to improve efficiency and productivity of the token. Eventually, we propose a secure ERC20 code that is not vulnerable to any of the attacks. Using auditing tools and comparing with the top ten ERC20 tokens shows the security of the proposal. It can be used as template to deploy new ERC20 tokens, migrate current vulnerable deployments or develop tools to automate auditing of ERC20 tokens.
