\begin{abstract}
ERC20 is the most prominent Ethereum standard for transferable tokens. Tokens implementing the ERC20 interface can interoperate with a large number of already deployed internet-based services and Ethereum-based smart contracts. In recent years, security vulnerabilities in ERC20 implementations have been uncovered. We (i) systemize these across 7 auditing tools into a set of 89 distinct vulnerabilities, and (ii) use our experience to provide a new secure implementation of the ERC20 interface, \sys, that is freely available and open source.\footnote{Implementation on Etherscan with source code and deployed on mainnet: \newline \url{https://bit.ly/2xvpnoh}}. We also (iii) analyze the top ten ERC20 tokens for comparison.
