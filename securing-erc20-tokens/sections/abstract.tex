\erc is the most prominent Ethereum standard for transferable tokens. Tokens implementing the \erc interface can interoperate with a large number of already deployed internet-based services and Ethereum-based smart contracts. In recent years, security vulnerabilities in \erc implementations have been uncovered. We (i) systemize these across 7 auditing tools into a set of \num distinct vulnerabilities {\chg and best practices}, and (ii) use our experience to provide a new secure implementation of the \erc interface, \sys, that is freely available and open source.\footnote{Implementation on Etherscan with source code and deployed on Mainnet: \newline \url{https://bit.ly/35FMbAf}}. We also (iii) analyze the top ten \erc tokens {\chg by market capitalization} for comparison.
