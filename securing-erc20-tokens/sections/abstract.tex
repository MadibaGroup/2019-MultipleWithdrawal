ERC20 is the most prominent Ethereum standard for transferable tokens. Tokens implementing the ERC20 interface can interoperate with a large number of already deployed internet-based services and Ethereum-based smart contracts. In recent years, security vulnerabilities in ERC20 implementations have been uncovered. We (i) systemize these into a set of 89 distinct vulnerabilities, (ii) review the performance of 7 auditing tools against our set, (iii) demonstrate the gap between these tools and our set using the top ten ERC20 tokens, and (iv) use our experience to provide a new secure implementation of the ERC20 interface that is freely available and open source.\footnote{Implementation on Etherscan with source code and deployed on mainnet: \newline \url{https://bit.ly/2xvpnoh}}
