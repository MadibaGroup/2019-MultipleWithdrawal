\begin{abstract}
ERC20 is one of the token standards in the Ethereum blockchain that is widely accepted in the industry. They are subset of smart contracts and similarly vulnerable to security flaws. In this paper, we (i) examine ERC20 vulnerabilities and propose a secure implementation, (ii) consider best practices to improve performance of the proposal for real-world scenarios (\ie ICOs, DApps, \etc), (iii) review the proposed Solidity code by 7 auditing tools and compare detected security issues with the top ten ERC20 tokens, (iv) provide list of 89 vulnerabilities and best practices that can be eventually turned into a security analysis tool for ERC20 tokens.
